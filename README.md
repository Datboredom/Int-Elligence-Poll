# Int-Elligence-Poll

This is a voting poll extension created to increase streamer-to-viewer interactivity. The idea is that the streamer enters a question and answers for the viewers to vote on. Then, the viewers pick their answer and view what everyone else chose as well.

Goals:
  1) Allow the streamer to enter custom questions and answers pertaining thier content and channel.
  2) Limit viewers to only voting once and the answer choices disappear after they choose. (Deeshai)
  3) Create a reset button that clears the results from the previous poll. (Amari)
  4) Add backend functionality so the viewers' results update among all the viewers' panels. (Erinn)
